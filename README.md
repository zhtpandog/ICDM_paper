Scripts for the ICDM paper publication.  

They are part of a Machine Learning pipeline that ingests documents in real-time, and make classifications of these documents. I cannot reveal other parts of the code since they are confidential. Codes listed here are just a small sample.  

1.model2.py: a supervised ML pipeline that takes in data and produce trained model, results, and visualizations.  

2.plotGraph.py: general plotting script for data generated by model2.py. But for convenience, model2.py includes plotting functions.  

3.unsupervisedModel.py: a unsupervised model & results.  


model2.py is the most important script in this project.
